# üõ°Ô∏è PhishGuard: A Full-Stack Phishing Detector

Yo, check out **PhishGuard**. It's this super cool app that's built to keep you safe from sketchy websites in real-time.  
It's a **Chrome extension**, but it's got a **Python-based FastAPI backend** working behind the scenes.  
It uses **Google's Gemini API** and **Google Search Grounding** to check out URLs and webpage content to find any hidden dangers.

## üöÄ What it Does
- **Real-time Checks**: Scans any webpage in a flash with just one click.  
- **AI-Powered Answers**: An awesome AI gives you a straight-up **"Phishing"** or **"Legitimate"** verdict. No confusing stuff, lol.  
- **Smart Info**: The AI's analysis gets a boost with real-time info from Google Search. It's way more accurate because of it.  
- **Super Secure**: It keeps the frontend (the extension) separate from the backend (the FastAPI server) so your API key stays safe and sound.

## üõ†Ô∏è Stuff You'll Need
To get the **FastAPI backend** running, you'll need **Python 3.9 or newer**, plus these packages you can install with the `requirements.txt` file we've got:

- fastapi  
- uvicorn  
- google-generativeai  
- python-dotenv
